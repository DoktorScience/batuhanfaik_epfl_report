# TU Delft - Unofficial Report Template (v1.2)
This template aims to simplify and improve the (Xe)LaTeX template provided by the TU Delft. Major changes are a redesigned cover page and a rewritten class file for easier customization. This template is made with Aerospace Engineering in mind (i.e. the included .bib entries and images are aerospace related), but it can be used universally.

## Cover

Six high quality cover images related to Aerospace Engineering have been included in this template. Please make sure to appropriately credit the cover page if you decide to use one of them. A preview can be seen below. A list with the attributions and recommended title color can be found below, in order of appearance in the preview. The images can be found under `/layout/covers`.
