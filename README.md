# TU Delft - Unofficial Report Template (v1.4.2)

This template aims to simplify and improve the (Xe)LaTeX report template by Delft University of Technology. Some of the main features:

* **Simplicity First:** A class file that has been reduced by over 60% to simplify customization;
* **Effortless:** Many common packages are included to get started immediately;
* **Complete:** Ready-to-go when it comes to file structure and files such as the nomenclature.

This template works with _pdfLaTeX_, _XeLaTeX_ and _LuaLaTeX_. In order to adhere to the TU Delft house style, either _XeLaTeX_ or _LuaLaTeX_ is required, as it supports TrueType and OpenType fonts. _BibLaTeX_ is used for the bibliography with as backend _biber_.
