\section{Changelog}

This template aims to simplify and improve the \LaTeX~template provided by the TU Delft, which has not seen an update in quite some time. A list of the changes can be found below. If you encounter issues or have suggestions, let me know over WhatsApp or create an issue \underline{\href{https://github.com/dzwaneveld/TU-Delft-Unofficial-Report-Template/issues}{here}}.

        \toprule

        & • & Redesigned the cover page \\
        \midrule 
        1.1 & • & Minor adjustments to the class file \\
        & • & Removed Natbib in favor of Bib\LaTeX. Adds more database entry types (e.g. @online) and other minor improvements. If you are using old websites entries, it is recommended to convert them, but it will work nonetheless. For a Bib\LaTeX~cheat sheet, see \url{http://tug.ctan.org/info/biblatex-cheatsheet/biblatex-cheatsheet.pdf} \\
        & • & Changed the font to Arial to be more in line with the TU Delft corporate design (see \url{https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tu-delft-corporate-design/}) \\
        & • & Added \emph{booktabs} to improve customisability of tables (e.g. \textbackslash toprule, \textbackslash midrule, \textbackslash bottomrule) \\
        & • & Fixed and added more book entries from 2nd year courses (e.g.  \cite{anderson-fundamentals-of-aerodynamics,megson-aircraft-structures}) \\
        & • & Converted the nomenclature tables to longtables which will break automatically over the page \\
        & • & Added xspace, which automatically selects the appropriate spacing after the \textbackslash deg macro (\deg) \\
        \midrule
        1.2 & • & Minor adjustments to the class file \\
        & • & Added more cover images. A detailed list with all attributions can be found on the next page. All images can be used and distributed freely if appropriate credit is given (all use a CC BY 2.0 license or similar) \\
        \bottomrule

\noindent The updates in-between consist of minor bug fixes.

\section{Credits to included images}

Six high quality cover images related to Aerospace Engineering have been included in this template. Please make sure to appropriately credit the cover page if you decide to use one of them. A preview can be seen below. A list with the attributions and recommended title color can be found below, in order of appearance in the preview.
